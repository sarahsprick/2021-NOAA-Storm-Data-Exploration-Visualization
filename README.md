# 2021-NOAA-Storm-Data-Exploration-Visualization

This project explores the 2021 Storm Events Database published by the National Centers for Environmental Information's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Recorded is data regarding the location, fatalities, and details of storms and other significant weather phenomena. 

The data used comes from the [NOAA's Storm Events Database](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ftp.jsp). The full 2021 year CSV files for bulk download are located [here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/). (At the time of use, files were last modified 2022-10-18 16:07) More information about the data can be found on the [FAQ page](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/faq.jsp) and information regarding the fields/columns can be found [here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/Storm-Data-Bulk-csv-Format.pdf).

Skills Used:
- DataFrame creation
- Data cleaning (nulls, changing column names, data types, etc.)
- Data transformation (concat strings into new columns, creating categorical variables, new columns based on mathematical calc)
- Loops
- Filtering
- Data visualization (bar charts (stacked and unstacked), maps, heatmaps)

Note: 
- Some visualizations do not display in GitHub, so I added screenshots in the repository
- Hyperlinks in the Jupyter Notebook will not work in GitHub
